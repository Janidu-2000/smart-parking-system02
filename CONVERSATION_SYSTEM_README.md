# Message Conversation System

This document describes the new message conversation system implemented in the Smart Parking System.

## Overview

The new system organizes messages by user conversations instead of individual messages. Each user gets their own "folder" containing all their messages and admin replies, providing a better chat-like experience.

## Features

### 1. User Conversation Folders
- **Grouped Messages**: Messages from the same user are grouped into conversation threads
- **User Information**: Each conversation shows user name, phone, email, and avatar
- **Message Count**: Displays total messages and unread count for each conversation
- **Last Message Preview**: Shows the most recent message content

### 2. Conversation View
- **Full Chat Interface**: Opens a dedicated conversation view for each user
- **Message History**: Shows all messages in chronological order
- **Admin Reply**: Allows admins to send messages directly in the conversation
- **Real-time Updates**: Messages are sent and displayed immediately

### 3. Enhanced Filtering & Search
- **Search Conversations**: Search by user name, phone, email, or message content
- **Status Filtering**: Filter by conversations with unread messages
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date, name, unread count, or priority
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## Components

### MessagePage.js
- **Main Interface**: Shows list of user conversation folders
- **Conversation Cards**: Each card represents a user's conversation
- **Navigation**: Click to open individual conversations

### ConversationView.js
- **Chat Interface**: Full-screen conversation view
- **Message Display**: Shows user and admin messages with timestamps
- **Input Form**: Admin can type and send new messages
- **Back Navigation**: Return to conversation list

### messageService.js
- **getConversationsFromFirestore()**: Fetches all user conversations
- **getConversationMessages()**: Gets messages for a specific user
- **sendMessageToConversation()**: Sends admin message to user conversation

## Data Structure

### Conversation Object
```javascript
{
  userId: "unique_user_identifier",
  userName: "User's Full Name",
  userEmail: "user@example.com",

  lastMessage: "Most recent message content",
  lastMessageTime: Date,
  unreadCount: 2,
  messageCount: 5,
  category: "general",
  priority: "normal",
  parkId: "parking_lot_id",
  messages: [/* array of message objects */]
}
```

  id: "message_id",
  message: "Message content",
  isAdminReply: true/false,
  timestamp: Date,
  status: "read/unread",
  category: "message_category",
  priority: "normal/high",
  replyTo: null // or reply context object
